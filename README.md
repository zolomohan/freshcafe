# About

Freshcafe is a cafeteria management application built on Rails.

The application supports 3 user roles:

- Customer
- Billing Clerk

## Roles of Customer

A customer can view the list of items and choose to add items to their cart. The items are segregated into categories for the users' convenience.

Once an item is added to the cart, the user can increase/decrease the quantity of each item in their cart. If needed, the user can remove an item from their cart. 

The cart will display the total price and the individual price of each item in the cart. The user can place his order by clicking on the checkout button.

A customer can also view all of his past orders from his profile page.

## Billing Clerk

In addition to the features that are accessible by the customer, A billing clerk can mark orders as delivered. When an order is placed, its default status is set to "Pending Delivery".
